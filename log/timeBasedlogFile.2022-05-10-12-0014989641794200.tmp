Expecting actual:
  models.Cart@6d91855
to be equal to:
  models.Cart@28f9b308
when recursively comparing field by field, but found the following difference:

field/property 'productsList' differ:
- actual value  : [models.Product@6aa2a1a9,
    models.Product@304900e,
    models.Product@4eae9569,
    models.Product@5dc77210]
- expected value: []
actual and expected values are collections of different size, actual size=4 when expected size=0

The recursive comparison was performed with this configuration:
- no overridden equals methods were used in the comparison (except for java types)
- these types were compared with the following comparators:
  - java.lang.Double -> DoubleComparator[precision=1.0E-15]
  - java.lang.Float -> FloatComparator[precision=1.0E-6]
  - java.nio.file.Path -> lexicographic comparator (Path natural order)
- actual and expected objects and their fields were compared field by field recursively even if they were not of the same type, this allows for example to compare a Person to a PersonDto (call strictTypeChecking(true) to change that behavior).
