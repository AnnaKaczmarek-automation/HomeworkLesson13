[main] I MyStoreTest.class - ( Lists are not equal. 
Expecting actual:
  models.Cart@67b560fe
to be equal to:
  models.Cart@45dde6ac
when recursively comparing field by field, but found the following difference:

field/property 'productsList' differ:
- actual value  : [models.Product@36df4c26, models.Product@76828577, models.Product@38732372]
- expected value: [models.Product@639cb788]
actual and expected values are collections of different size, actual size=3 when expected size=1

The recursive comparison was performed with this configuration:
- no overridden equals methods were used in the comparison (except for java types)
- these types were compared with the following comparators:
  - java.lang.Double -> DoubleComparator[precision=1.0E-15]
  - java.lang.Float -> FloatComparator[precision=1.0E-6]
  - java.nio.file.Path -> lexicographic comparator (Path natural order)
- actual and expected objects and their fields were compared field by field recursively even if they were not of the same type, this allows for example to compare a Person to a PersonDto (call strictTypeChecking(true) to change that behavior).
